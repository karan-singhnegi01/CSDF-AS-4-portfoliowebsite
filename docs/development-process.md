# Development Process

The development of the portfolio website followed these steps:

### 1. Project Setup
- Created the project folder in my system.
- Opened the folder using **Visual Studio Code**.
- Created two main files: `index3-1.html` and `html3-1.css`.

### 2. Building the HTML Structure
- Added the basic HTML boilerplate.
- Created sections for Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
- Inserted my profile photo and project images (Calorie Tracker screenshots).

### 3. Designing with CSS
- Styled the layout (flexbox, margins, padding, backgrounds).
- Added fonts, colors, and formatting.
- Improved spacing and alignment for a clean layout.
- Ensured the design looks neat on different screen sizes.
- implemented animations using keyframes.

### 4. Testing the Website
- Opened `index3-1.html` in the browser to check layout.
- Adjusted CSS for small display issues.

### 5. Using Git & GitHub
- Initialized Git using `git init`.
- Added files and made multiple commits.
- Pushed the project to GitHub repository:
  `CSDF-AS-4-portfoliowebsite`

### 6. Documentation
- Created `README.md` describing the project.
- Added website screenshots.
- Created this `/docs` folder for assignment documentation.

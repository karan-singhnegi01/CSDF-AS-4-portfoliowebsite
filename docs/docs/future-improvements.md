# Future Improvements

Although the current version of my portfolio is functional, there are several improvements I can add in the future:

### 🔹 1. Make the Website Fully Responsive
- Improve layout so it works on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

### 🔹 2. Add Navigation Bar
- A fixed navbar that allows users to jump between sections easily.

### 🔹 3. Add More Projects
- Include more of my work as I build new projects.

### 🔹 4. Improve Styling and Animations
- Smooth hover effects  
- Fade-in animations  
- Better typography  

### 🔹 5. Add Contact Form
- Allow visitors to send messages directly from the site.

### 🔹 6. Convert to Multi-Page Portfolio
- Add dedicated pages: Projects, About Me, Resume.

These improvements will make the portfolio more professional and visually appealing in the future.
